# How I Want to Run the Game
## Conversation
The game is a conversation, in which the players primarily do two things:
1. Declarations of character. This is done in the first/third person present; and limited to the "scene" in a rather implicit way. Players make declarations about their own character, or details from their creation.
2. Ask questions about the world. Whatever asked, the characters either know or know where to find out. Such a source may be esoteric, and worthy of a quest in and of itself.

## Declaration
1. Is it impossible? If so, communicate your assumptions to find understanding. 
2. Is there an obstacle? Generate its Challenge (qualities, threats, and hits).
3. It happens.

## Challenge
A Challenge is defined by its Qualities, Threats, and Hit Protection.  

* Qualities tip the scale of what can be done.  
* Threats are harm or other consequences that the Challenge could inflict on the Players.  
* Hits are a tracker for how long the challenge will take until it is overcome.  

Challenges highlight the fiction, not define it. As the story evolves, the Challenge should fluidly be adapted or bypassed all together.  

## Success
Player success when dealing with Threats should be determined by the following flowchart:  
1. Drama -> Deal or Dilemma
2. Karma -> It happens
3. Fortune -> Roll a Save (Conflicting Action) or Luck (d6-based odds)
