# How I Want to Run the Game
## Conversation
The game is a conversation, in which the players do two things primarily:
1. Decalarations of character. This is done in the first person present, and limited to the "scene" in a rather implicit way. Players make declarations of their own characters, or if questioned details related to their history/slice of the world.
2. Questions about the world. Whatever asked, the characters either know or know where to find out. Such a source may be esoteric, and worthy of a quest in and of itself.

## Decalarations
1. Is it impossible? If so, try to ask about why they think it's possible to know what assumptions are misleading the player.
2. Is there an obstacle? Generate its Challenge (qualities, threats, hits).
3. It happens.

## Challenge
1. Drama -> Deal or Dilemma
2. Karma -> It happens
3. Fortune -> Roll a Save (Conflicting Action) or Luck (d6 odds)
