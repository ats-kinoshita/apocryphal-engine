These are the procedures I wish to use when running any game.

# How I Want to Run the Game
## Conversation
The game is a conversation, in which the GM and Players primarily do two things:
1. Declarations of character. This is done in the first/third person present; and limited to the "scene" in a rather implicit way. Players make declarations about their own character, or details from their creation.
2. Ask questions about the world. Whatever asked, the player characters either know or know where to find out. Such a source may be esoteric, and worthy of a quest in and of itself.

The cycle of play inherited from Blades in the Dark is the following:
1. Presentation
2. Development
3. Threat/Cost
4. Payoff

## GM Response
When responding to Player Declarations in Free Play, fallback to one of the following:
1. Introduce a Cost/Threat (Drama)
2. It happens (Karma)
3. ... but to what degree? (Fortune)

When responding to Player Questions fallback to either they: 
1. Know the information, or
2. Know where to find out.

## GM Resources
There are two generative tables I like to rely on:  

*Characteristic Roll*  
1. Little
2. Some
3. Lots
4. Hazard
5. Negation
6. Extreme

*Threat Roll*
1. Charged/Pressing
2. Strange/Haunted
3. Security/Hunted
4. Tricky/Trapped
5. Social/Discredited
6. Violent/Violated

## Challenge  
A Challenge is defined by its Qualities, Threats, and Hit Protection.  

* Hits are a tracker for how long the challenge will take until it is overcome.
* Qualities tip the scale of what can be done.  
* Threats are harm or other consequences that the Challenge could inflict on the Players.  

Hits might follow this format :  
1. Immediate (one-off Threat)
2. Simple (less than or equal half your tier)
3. Normal (less than your tier)
4. Challenging (equal tier)
5. Complex (greater tier)
6. Daunting (greater than or equal twice your tier)  

Note Challenges highlight the fiction, not define it. As the story evolves, the Challenge should fluidly adapt or be passed over.  
I would like to eventually define an Engagement Roll a la Blades in the Dark.  

## Success
### Threat Neutralization (i.e. Action/Goal Resolution)
Plans of Action for dealing with Threats should be called on by considering the following flowchart:  
1. Save -> Build your Action dice pool based on your Plan of Action 
2. Suck -> It happens (no time to plan / prompt a chance to Resist)  

The Position of the Action determines how immediate the Threat is ([Suck,] Desperate, Risky, Controlled).  

The Effect of the Action determines the effectiveness of the plan to overcome the Threat ([None,] Limited, Standard, Great).
