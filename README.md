These are the procedures I wish to use when running any game.

# How I Want to Run the Game
## Conversation
The game is a conversation, in which the players primarily do two things:
1. Declarations of character. This is done in the first/third person present; and limited to the "scene" in a rather implicit way. Players make declarations about their own character, or details from their creation.
2. Ask questions about the world. Whatever asked, the characters either know or know where to find out. Such a source may be esoteric, and worthy of a quest in and of itself.

whereas the GM primarily does the following:
1. Give Presentation to the scene and setting
2. Ask Developing Questions about the initial position or background of the PCs and their NPCs/settings
3. Introduce Twists (Deals, Dilemmas, Threats/Challenges)
4. Prompt/Deliver the Resolution (possibly progress to a different stage of play)

The cycle of play inherited from Blades in the Dark is the following:
1. Free Play
2. Engagement Roll
3. Challenge/Score
4. Payoff/Recovery  

## Consideration
1. Is there an obstacle? Generate its Challenge (Hits, Qualities, Threats).
2. Is it possible? Consider the 3 part resolution (Drama, Karma, Fortune)  

## Challenge
A Challenge is defined by its Qualities, Threats, and Hit Protection.  

* Hits are a tracker for how long the challenge will take until it is overcome.
* Qualities tip the scale of what can be done.  
* Threats are harm or other consequences that the Challenge could inflict on the Players.  

Hits might follow this format :  
1. Immediate
2. Simple (less than or equal half your tier)
3. Normal (less than your tier)
4. Challenging (equal tier)
5. Complex (greater tier)
6. Daunting (greater than or equal twice your tier)  

Challenges highlight the fiction, not define it. As the story evolves, the Challenge should fluidly be adapted or bypassed all together.  
I would like to eventually define an Engagement Roll a la Blades in the Dark.  

## Success
### Threat Neutralization (i.e. Action/Goal Resolution)
Plans for dealing with Threats from Challenges should be determined by the following flowchart:  
1. Save -> Build your Action dice pool based on your Plan of Action 
2. Suck -> It happens (prompt a chance to Resist)  

The Position of the Action determines how immediate the Threat is ([Suck,] Desperate, Risky, Controlled).  

The Effect of the Action determines the effectiveness of the plan to overcome the Threat ([None,] Limited, Standard, Great).  

### Declaration Resolution
Declarations otherwise should be resolved by the following flowchart:  
1. Drama -> Deal or Dilemma  
2. Karma -> It happens  
3. Fortune -> Roll a Save (Conflicting Action) or Luck (d6-based odds)
