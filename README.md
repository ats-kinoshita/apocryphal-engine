## Rules Summary
### Saves
Roll a d20 under your Attribute’s current value.
1 always succeeds; 20 always fails and tests Panic.

### Attacks
Roll weapon die, d4 if Impaired, d12 if Enhanced. Spend the roll reducing HP to 0, then Body. 
The target’s AP reduces Attacks by that amount.

### Critical Hits
If an Attack damages the Body, roll Body Save. Failure means Incapacitation or worse.
Sacrificing your Shield negates the failed Save.

### Rest & Recovery
A few moments out of combat is a Quick Rest: 
> Recover HP; get up if Incapacitated
A full night of sleep is a Long Rest:
> Recover +1 to damaged stats on Save
If Deprived, no Recovery on Rest.

### Combat
Declare Movement and Action each Round. 
Resolve all simultaneously.
Poise or Reflex Save against being Surprised.
Conflicting Outcomes force most at risk to Save.

### Gambits
Combat Maneuvers happen:
> On Critical Hit if it takes out the target
> As a Conflicting Outcome otherwise
Other Gambits are resolved by:
> A Dilemma, choose one or push for better
> It Happens, live with the consequences
> A Roll, either a Save or plain Luck (d6 roll low)

### Supply
Carry as much or as little Supply you want.
Expected Use is done without question.
Creative Use needs a check after for Depletion.

### Panic
Roll Stress Save: if Stressed, consult Panic Table.
On a 1, roll a d12; take as new Max HP if higher.

## Game Mechanics
### Character Stats
Your ability to handle danger is defined by your Harm Protection (HP) and Attribute Stats: 
> HP reflects your potential to evade fate
> Body is your conditioning and constitution
> Calm is your composure when pressured
> Sanity is your clarity under duress
You can Carry a number of items equal to your current Body stat. However, if  you carry three or more items of cumbersome Quality then your HP reduces to 0 from the unwieldy burden.

### Saving Throws
To resist the consequences of your actions or inactions make an Attribute Save: 
> Determine the most relevant Attribute
> Roll a d20 under or equal the current value
Rolling 1 always succeeds, while 20 always fails.

### Making Attacks
When trying to Attack someone, you roll your weapon’s die to see how it goes: 
> For Impaired Attacks you roll a d4 instead
> For Enhanced Attacks you roll a d12 instead
A weapon with a relevant Quality to affect multiple targets rolls Attacks against all in range.

### Taking & Dealing Damage
An Attack targeting the Body is reduced by any Armour Points (AP) the target has (3 AP max). 
The remaining Attack is spent reducing the target’s HP to 0, then their Body: 
> Damaging the Body stat means a successful Hit
> If Hit, make a Body Save or take a Critical Hit
> Reducing Body to 0 this way means Death
Special Attacks may likewise target other stats.

### Critical Hits
Taking a Critical Hit usually means being Incapacitated until you can have a Quick Rest. However, particularly nasty threats may have worse consequences, such as serious Ailments, Injuries, or even Death. If you have a Shield, you can Sacrifice it to negate the Critical.

### Rest & Recovery
When out of Combat and able to take a few moments for a Quick Rest, characters Recover their HP to full and can get back to their feet if Incapacitated. When able to have a full night’s Long Rest, characters roll Saves for each damaged Attribute, Recovering +1 to those that succeed. Faster options exist, but usually at a cost.

### Attribute Loss
Some dangers may cause Attribute Loss, bypassing AP and HP entirely, and will have their own effects upon reducing an Attribute to 0.

### Deprivation
If you are Deprived of basic necessities (sleep, food, water, warmth, or air) then you cannot Recover from any Rest. Certain Ailments and Injuries cause this as well.

### Combat Rounds
When the order of action is a life or death matter, Combat is initiated. Characters announce what they will do in a round, which is then resolved simultaneously. In a round a character may both: 
> Move nearby, including simple interactions
> Take Action, like an Attack or Gambit
Characters Surprised when Combat is initiated must make a Calm  Save or miss the first round. Conflicting Outcomes are resolved by the party most at risk making a Save.

### Gambits
When trying to do a Combat Maneuver (such as called shots, disarming, or tripping), consider if it directly takes the target out: 
> If so, then it happens on a Critical Hit
> If not, resolve it like a Conflicting Outcome
Other Gambits outside direct Combat (such as parleys, shadowing, or silent kills) will be adjudicated by the GM case by case; likely by:
> Deal or Dilemma, choose or push for better
> It Happens, live with the consequences
> A Roll, either a Save or plain Luck (d6 roll high)

## Adventuring
### Stress & Panic
Horrors and failing Saves will build up Stress, a negative Attribute (which reduces on Recovery). When you fail a Save, increase Stress by 1. Whenever you roll 20 on a Save, roll for Panic: 
> Make a Stress Save
> On success, consult Panic Table with your roll 

### Panic Table
1	Focus: Roll d12; new HP if higher
2, 3	Racing Heart: +1 Stress
4, 5	Anxiety: +1 Stress to you & nearby
6, 7	Outburst: +2 Stress to you & nearby
8, 9	Overload: Get Ailment, nearby Panic
10-12	Despair: Panic if nearby fail Saves
13-15	Delirium: Fail all Sanity Saves
16-18	Catatonia: Unresponsive
19, 20	Heart Attack: Dying, d20 min. left

### Expeditions
You are expected to be properly equipped for any Expedition. This comes in the form of Resource Supply, an item that is individually enough for the whole crew’s Usage regarding the resource.
> Carry as much or as little Supply you want
> Expected Use is done without question
> Creative Use needs a check after for Depletion:
  1-3: OK / 4, 5: One Use left / 6: Depleted
> Examples: Food / Water / First Aid / Oxygen /
            Camping / Climbing / Maintenance

### Commerce and Scarcity
Outside overly dense archologies or colony ships, most live sparsely across planetary systems. As such, sourcing goods is not always so easy. 
Things with a base price of 100 credits or less can be sought in any settlement, but might be anywhere from 2-10 times base price due to scarcity. Anything more than that can only be bartered for, or sourced at major urban sprawls, and not always legally. Asset Value generally indicates the order of base price in 10’s of credits (i.e. Tools or Weapons start in the 10's, 
Augments or Drones start in the 100's, 
Armour or Vehicles start in the 1000’s).
