# How I Run the Game
## Core Resolution
In a TRPG, questions and declarations *are* gameplay.  
When resolving questions, give them the information they are looking for or offer where they might find it.  
When resolving declarations, follow this flow chart:  
1. Can you offer them an interesting Deal to get the success they want?  
	If so, give them the choice to pay/play or push for better.
	
2. Is there a reason not to let the declaration pass?  
	If so, give them information about the obstacles and ask how they proceed.  
	
3. If none of the above, let the declaration become the narrative of the world.  
	Continue any ongoing procedures or move into downtime.  

## Dealing with Dice
One Deal you can offer is a #Save# against some ill-fate:  
1. Consider who is most at risk in the situation.  
2. Roll a d20 against that character's most relevant stat

## Everything is a Challenge
This is fundamentally a Skill Challenge.  
For every Challenge, list out all the Threats that come to mind. 
> Threats are harm or other consequences that the Challenge could inflict on the Players.  
> 
Write down any Qualities that tip the scale of what can be done.  
Record how many Hits the challenge will take until it is overcome.  
Threats, Qualities, and Hits should be visible to the Players.  
The GM will roll for the threats with a die of the same number (rounding up).  
The Players then announce how they overcome that Threat, and the GM adjudicates if it is viable. If so, replace the Threat with a Triumph.  
If the GM rolls on a Triumph or an unlisted number, the Challenge takes a Hit and the Players can describe their successful plan.  
Challenges highlight the fiction, not define it. As the story evolves, the Challenge should fluidly adapted or bypassed.
